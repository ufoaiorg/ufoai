Overview

Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided to replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice of dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even got out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two surviving examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I can't even find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm doing my best to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up to the task.

The one bit of good luck in this dropship mess is that I managed to persuade our UN rep to earmark some budget for a new ship, and I think you'll like it.

The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.

The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach 1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose. It can also carry additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers.

There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than any fixed-wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to threats all over the world.

The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 1 light weapon hardpoint located in the nose.


Recommended Doctrine

The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity and to recover downed alien craft.

While armed, a Firebird-class dropship is not able to stand up to dedicated fighters, and it should never be sent as the sole interceptor to any UFO sighting.

text "_Commander, I'm pleased to present the schematics for the Herakles-class Heavy Lifter.

To speed the development of this dropship, we adapted the design from an existing airborne lifter vehicle that is used in the civilian sector for the movement of extremely heavy goods. The craft consists of a lifting vehicle and a dead pod -- an inert cargo container that we have converted to house up to 12 troops.

The craft has VTOL capabilities, but we've upgraded the propulsion systems to achieve faster cruising speeds. We've also encased both the vehicle and the pod in advanced armour plating that relies on human-sourced materials to keep costs down. The Herakles should get our soldiers on-site faster and safer than the firebird.

Like the Firebird, we have incorporated a single light weapon hardpoint in the nose, but this is only for last-ditch defensive efforts. The Herakles is a troop transport and should be kept safe from any armed UFOs.

We should get at least one of these built as soon as possible. We won't need the larger ground assault force for every mission, but if we're going to take down an alien installation we'll want the extra firepower.

This craft takes advantage of everything we've learned adapting alien technology to our fighter craft as well as our analysis of how the Gunboat packed a large alien squad into a UFO designed for air superiority. We've covered the aircraft in layers of alien materials for impressive resistance to explosives. It won't stand up to the kinds of assaults our interceptors face from the most powerful UFOs, but it can chase down and destroy light UFOs. To assist it in these battles, we've designated a medium weapon hardpoint for each wing and a light weapon hardpoint for the nose.

The Raptor fits up to 10 soldiers safely in its hull, but they have to be strapped in to withstand the pressures of air combat. Soldiers exit below the aircraft, which is raised on unusually tall landing gear, so they will be unable to use the craft as a defensive position once landed.

This is the first dropship to use the aliens' antimatter engines, so be sure you've got spare antimatter in storage to refuel this craft. Have our workers build one of these in our most crowded bases. It will free up other aircraft to focus on more dangerous threats.

PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit

Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only

Overview

I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight tests with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be the finest piece of human technology ever produced.

The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a sophisticated air channeling system that actively filters the air in front of the engine and redirects any piece of material large enough to harm the fan blades. They are more than powerful enough to lift the heavily-armoured fuselage and can hover unassisted for an extended period before burning through all their fuel.

The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.

Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the target at all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and acquire missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.

Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- but is not limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar system, and optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM emitters placed in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off missile lock and can actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints can take a variety of armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to accept upgrades. Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.

The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, its maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, within this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.

Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been described by our test crews as 'tricky'.

The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 heavy wing mounts.


Recommended Doctrine

The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe with anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be deployed against distant targets as it won't have enough fuel for both attack manoeuvres and the flight back to base.

Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race is in trouble.


Addenda

Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:

Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they held in their hands until now. What we have here is probably the most manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame and can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most modern aircraft can't even dream of.

It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. However, Commander al-Kuhar of the air wing insists that our pilots can handle it, and I think I believe him. Even better, we've managed to track down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right now being restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit and flight testing on my own authority.

This is simply the best knife-fighting aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. We're going to need it."

Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only

Filed: 19 March 2084

By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command



Overview

It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.

Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military airplane still flying today.

In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the restrictions of our hangar facilities.

Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, and more.

Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts into weapons capacity. The Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.

The Saracen requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 2 medium weapon hardpoints.


Recommended Doctrine

At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.

As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able to cut up alien craft of all varieties.

msgid inter_dragon_txt {
text "_Commander, I'm extremely proud to present you with the plans for our new interceptor, the Dragon. As you can see we've taken more than one page out of the aliens' book and the radical styling truly pays off.

Incorporating new technologies from the ground up, the Dragon consists of an inner skeleton of alien materials providing strength for the lighter outer skin of carbon nanotube-reinforced plastics. This allows it to mount two actual alien engines which give speed and power like nothing else in our arsenal. The forward-swept wings are a special touch to allow it more knife-fighting mobility than alien designs.

The three-pronged fuselage is also inspired by the enemy, slicing through the air with remarkable grace. The upper two prongs can mount onboard electronics to enhance evasion and targeting. Two heavy weapon hardpoints are located in the center -- the 'mouth', if you will -- for which the Dragon was named.

The main drawback of the Dragon is that, like UFOs, it requires antimatter to get into the air. Nothing else will do considering the weight of the fuselage. Since our supplies of antimatter are so limited it may be that we can't afford to spend it on anything but our airfleet. That's why we should be careful about where we deploy the Dragon, and consider whether or not its deployment is really necessary in any given situation.

Also, please note that while the Dragon is technically capable of entering orbit on its own steam, it has no space capabilities and should not be pushed above the upper atmosphere under any circumstances. Some things are just too much to ask right now. We're engineers, Commander, not wizards.

text "_Commander, let me preface this by saying it's obvious that the aliens have been severely outperforming us in every way, but nowhere is this more evident than in the air. We were in a bad position at the start of the war and despite our efforts there has been little improvement.

However, now that we have an understanding of alien materials and how they behave in the air, as well as alien engines and fuelling systems, I think my team and I are ready to tackle the task of creating an entirely new interceptor exclusive to PHALANX. We believe that by combining alien techniques with good old human manufacturing we can design something that will be vastly superior to our current-generation craft while remaining economically feasible to produce and to fly.

The program will incur considerable expenses in lab time, personnel and materials, but as always we stand to gain much more than we could possibly lose. It's a project that could rally a lot of hope for our cause, Commander. Please let me know as soon as possible when you want us to start work.

It's greatest advantage is its alien-tech propulsion system that, along with its sleek, aerodynamic design, bestows it with much greater speed than the Dragon interceptor. The hull itself is made out of dense layers of alien materials, providing an unprecedented level of durability. Finally, despite the fact that the compact design prevented us from expanding the modular weapon and support systems as much as we would have liked, we have managed to add an additional light weapon hardpoint on top of the two heavy weapon hardpoints available on the Dragon. This should help for those close-up dogfights.

The Starchaser is truly the next generation in aerial combat, commander. It matches or outperforms any other fighter design we have, so I recommend we begin phasing it in immediately. Be advised, however, that the Starchaser is more costly to produce.

text "_Commander, we've done it. Let me present to you the crowning achievement of my career: the Stingray Heavy-payload Fighter.

The first thing you'll notice is its distinctive shape and armour plating. I know some of the pilots who had a look at the early drawings were a little wary of flying something that looks so alien, but I assure you every inch of this aircraft's design is there for a reason. We chucked out all of our assumptions and set about rethinking what we were doing. I'm happy to say the result is an aircraft that is lighter, faster and more heavily weaponised than anything in our arsenal.

The Stingray's swept wings provide excellent stability at the extraordinary speeds it reaches. Because of the way we shape the alien materials for maximum cohesion, we were able to build the durability of the aircraft into its outer casing and gut the interior mechanisms which would typically reinforce the aircraft's armour. As a result, we can mount heavier weapon emplacements than we could on a comparable craft built with a more traditional design.

This should give us something to deal with the frightening new UFOs we're facing in the sky. I recommend you get the Stingray into action as soon as possible.

I want a shot at replicating this in our own designs.

We have dubbed this class of UFO the 'Scout', as that seems to be its purpose here on Earth. It makes sense. Every modern military force needs intelligence more than anything.

Here are the major technical details:

-- The craft has only a small fuel tank and few provisions for a crew. It seems designed for little more than coming down from orbit, flying around a bit, and then returning.

-- We have determined the craft to be unarmed, but it's equipped with what appears to be a large suite of sensors contained in the four protrusions around the cockpit. Curiously, it seems to mount no communications equipment that we can identify, which would defeat the purpose of a scout. Your guess is as good as ours, sir.

Beyond that the craft has no particular distinguishing characteristics.

As I said, this UFO type is used primarily as a reconnaissance unit and vanguard to scout the way for heavier craft. Though unarmed, we should shoot these things down whenever we're not otherwise engaged, because anything the aliens are up to is bound to be bad for us.

msgid ufo_fighter_txt {
text "_Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.

The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien expeditions. It is frequently deployed to engage aerial targets or even as a diversion to mask some other mission somewhere else.

It's not as manouverable as some UFOs we've observed, but it's certainly fast, with a tough airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side to compensate for the increased heat output of the chunky antimatter engines. It mounts a single weapon system under the nose of the craft. This weapon, some type of high-energy particle beam, will require thorough research before we will be able to make any conclusions about it. However, it's obvious just from our combat recordings that this weapon is extremely dangerous. It fires a beam of particles at a good fraction of the speed of light, giving it significant range before the atmosphere can slow and/or disperse the particles enough to render them harmless.

The Fighter features no discernible communications equipment, nor does it mount landing gear. What it does have, however, is a large targeting computer and holographic HUD to make the craft even more effective in air engagements.

Combined with our work on UFO theory, the analysis of the Fighter has led us to some new conclusions about these smaller classes of UFO. While faster than most things in Earth's sky, the Fighter is still not very speedy for a craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien hull materials, they could easily stand more engine stresses if required. The aliens could certainly build more powerful engines with their current technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel volatility.

The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are very small and very heavily armoured. Obviously the aliens aren't taking any unnecessary risks. The few tenths of a gramme of antimatter that a small UFO can safely carry seem to be just enough to complete a planet mission and return to base. If the UFO does manage to lose containment, the amount of antimatter in its tanks will not be enough to harm nearby craft.

Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. However, their function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more than armed reconnaissance.

msgid ufo_supply_txt {
text "_Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.

As far as we can determine, this type of UFO is indeed a transporter of some kind, carrying materials in its large cargo hold and a sizeable team of aliens in a passenger compartment behind the cockpit. Satellite surveillance has observed these ships landing at alien-held positions and unloading material and passengers. This is strong evidence in support of the 'supply ship' theory, and we're confident that it's correct.

We can make several conclusions from the UFO's construction and the cargo we've recovered from the hold. Unlike other UFOs we've seen, the Supply Ship is built for carrying heavy loads rather than surviving combat. It doesn't manoeuver very well, its engines are weak by comparison, and its airframe will break up easily when hit.

There isn't much that an alien cargo ship could be doing on Earth except reinforcement and resupply. It will be bringing in weapons, spare parts and other supplies from the alien homeworld to Earth in support of alien operations on the surface. This should be prevented at all costs -- permanent alien installations on Earth would place the civilian population in the area in extreme danger. A strong alien presence also hampers our operations in many ways, some too subtle to observe directly. The regular operation of Supply Ships in an area may indicate an alien installation under construction or, worse, one that's already operational.

In conclusion, although it may seem of lesser importance than the other UFOs we've encountered, the Supply Ship should be engaged whenever possible. The long-term benefits of interrupting alien supplies may not be immediately apparent, but it will show over time.

The Bomber is equipped with the thickest armour we've seen and more onboard technology and weaponry than any other UFO. But if it is meant to be a heavy fighter craft they could have fit this onto a much smaller and faster vehicle.

Eventually, it was the size and emptiness that led us to the only conclusion we can fathom: this UFO's purpose is to deliver troops to combat.

This UFO, which we've come to call the Corrupter, is a nightmare of alien medical technology. It makes only a few concessions to air combat. Its main purpose, without a shadow of a doubt, is to land on Earth and carry out hideous operations on human victims.

Where previous alien equipment seemed to focus mostly on collecting human biomass, the Corrupter's interior -- particularly the massive blood transfusion banks -- are geared towards the capture and alteration of complete, live human beings. The alcoves I mentioned in my proposal are still mysterious, but going by the wear patterns on the floors they seem to be used to store some kind of heavy alien robot or cargo equipped with tank treads. Heavy harnesses drop down from the ceiling to hold these robots in place during flight, and the alcoves seem to have some type of air-drop mechanism as well.

It's difficult to speculate exactly what goes on in these UFOs with regards to captured civilians. Clearly it has something to do with the alien harvesting of human biomass, but they already have craft for that which do not appear to be in any way obsolete. Instead we have to suspect that the Corrupter represents a paradigm shift in alien activity on Earth. Something has changed. Until we fully understand what's happening, we need to prepare ourselves for what could be the worst threat to the global population we've ever seen.

The Corrupter presents a major ground threat due to its large crew complement. More than any other craft we've encountered, the Corrupter is purpose-built to deliver large alien forces to the surface.

We've dubbed this UFO the 'Gunboat', and the name tells you a great deal about its intended function. Its weapons and armour exceed that of UFOs twice its size. As near as we can tell it was designed for the role of heavy fighter/interceptor, and it fulfills that role magnificently.

The UFO is armed with two particle beam weapons as well as -- very interestingly -- two additional modular hardpoints of a design almost identical to the weapon hardpoints on our own aircraft. Even more interesting is the Gunboat's armour, an improvement over the standard skin of alien materials we saw on the first wave of invading UFOs. This new armour is a composite layer-cake of alien materials and various other substances designed to slow and stop projectiles from penetrating. The basic principle is simple enough but the new compounds have interesting properties which we're not sure we fully understand. I'll see if my team can make anything of it and, if so, I'll have a new research proposal ready for you soon.

The fuselage design of the Gunboat is still ostensibly that of a spacecraft, but it has certain adaptations that make it much easier to handle in atmosphere. It has actual wing surface generating lift, unlike the small claw-winged designs which relied on brute engine power to stay airborne. Furthermore, mobile flaps on the wings and stabilisers -- much like on human aircraft -- allow the Gunboat to use the airflow over its surfaces, giving it a much tighter turning circle, a far higher angle of attack and a tremendous rate of climb compared to a UFO moving on engine power alone.

Overall the Gunboat is fast, maneuverable and utterly deadly. It seems to outperform previously-observed UFOs on every level; faster, tougher, better-armed and more nimble. The only positive is that it would take three or four times as much material to build a Gunboat compared to a small attack craft and twice as much fuel to keep it flying, so it's unlikely we'll see Gunboats in large numbers. My only worry is that they won't need very many of these to pound us into dust. Extreme caution is advised, Commander, and I recommend we spend some time and money upgrading our airfleet as soon as we can.

text "_Commander, we've recovered a new UFO type which is now waiting in our hangar for disassembly. Going by the extremely heavy armament it seems to be some kind of heavy fighter or fire support model, its size class somewhere in between those of the UFOs we've observed so far.

This is the first new alien craft we've seen since discovering the Fighter that is unmistakably purpose-built for combat. What's even more disturbing is that it has certain features, innovations, which we theorise make the craft more suited for atmospheric flight. I think we need to have a look at this right away as it may represent a significant shift in alien goals and tactics.

We're ready to start studying and dismantling the craft whenever you say, but we will need some lab time and funding to make a proper assessment of its function and capabilities.

text "_Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.

This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's crew has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they return to the UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to wherever it is they came from.

The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being the main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster than any other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more antimatter fuel and protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, thicker armour, and more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. Even if an explosion does occur, most of the blast will be contained by the UFO's extremely strong construction.

The Harvester's fuel tank can take up to 0.6 grammes of antimatter and possesses a potential explosive force of approximately 25 kilotons when full.

There are three front-facing weapon mounts arranged in a triangle around the craft's cockpit, each equipped with the particle beam weapon we've observed in other UFOs.

In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-priority target. Its firepower is more than a match for anything we can currently field. Its only obvious drawback is low manoeuvrability compared to smaller UFO types. Our interceptors are significantly more agile and we have far more combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do. This is one of the few advantages we'll have over the Harvester, but in most cases it won't be sufficient unless we upgrade our aerial capabilities.

When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots on a Harvester to take it out as fast as possible.

Our estimates of the Harvester's increased capabilities raise some frightening points. It seems that alien craft will actually grow faster as they become larger and more powerful, and there's no doubt that, if they can build these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. Without upgrades to our airfleet, we may not be able to stand up to more dangerous threats in the future.

Please, do what you can about this when you can, Commander. I'd hate for us to be caught unprepared.

This one is significantly larger than previous UFOs we've observed, making it an especially important target for our research. Uncovering the craft's purpose and examining its special equipment may give us essential new insights into the aliens' mission here on Earth.

We're ready to start studying and dismantling the craft whenever you say, but we will need some lab time and funding to make a proper assessment of its function and capabilities.
