Textures and other 2D Art
-------------------------

Most of the textures are created by SparX. A few textures have been taken from public collections and are supposed to be public domain. If this is not the case and we are using one of your textures, please email me: sparxx@gmx.ch We will replace the texture in the next version.
The textures can be used for all UFO related projects (mods). If you want to use them for something else, please drop me a line. Do not use them for commercial projects.
