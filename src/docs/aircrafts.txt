1. Dropship

[dropship_txt]
The H-92 dropship is the main troop transport for the Phalanx rapid intervention forces. Powered by four General Electrics HM-5600 turbo jet engines, this dropship achieves a top speed of mach 1.0. The four engine exhausts can be pivoted so the H-92 has the ability to take off and land vertically. This technical feature is essential for rapidly deploying troops to any location\n
nworldwide. On the downside the H-92 has hardly no combat value because of only minor armament. Therefore Phalanx commanders always have some interceptors stading by for air cover if a H-92 encounters a enemy UFO.

2. Interceptor

[interceptor_txt]
The F-48 is the backbone of the Phalanx air superiority force. Powered by two Volkot VO-36 jet engines, this aircraft reaches a maximum speed of mach 1.4. This is significantly slower than many of the alien UFOs, but regarding the maneuverability the F-48 can easily compete with almost all of its adversaries. Like the H-92 dropship, the F-48 has the ability to take off and land vertically. Therefore many Phalanx bases have vertical shafts leading form the surface to the subterranean flight hangars. This has been proven to be safest way to make a airfield almost completely undetectable.
