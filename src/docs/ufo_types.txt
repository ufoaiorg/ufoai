1. "Scout"
[description]
A small craft sent out by the Antareans to survey the landscape and identify possible scientific and military targets.
[armament]
None.
[personnel]
Two Worker-class Antareans.
[notes]
Scouts aren't very fast and are easily shot down. They are the UFO's most commonly seen in the early stages of the game, but will continue to survey Earth throughout the course of the campaign.

2. "Fighter"
[description]
A small craft that patrols the Antarean arena of operations and neutralizes any threats. It is also used as a vanguard for larger Antarean battle fleets.
[armament]
Two light fusion cannons.
[personnel]
Two Worker-class Antareans.
[notes]
Fighters move somewhat faster than Scouts. They will also engage any human landing craft they discover.

3. "Cruiser"
[description]
A larger edition of the Fighter. These craft bring up the flanks of the Antarean battle fleet, but can also operate on their own. On Earth, their mission is seek and destroy.
[armament]
Two heavy fusion cannons.
[personnel]
Three Worker-class Antareans, two Soldier-class Antareans.
[notes]
Cruisers are faster than Fighters, but also larger, making them somewhat easier to hit. They will also engage any human landing craft they discover.

4. "Transport"
[description]
Transports are slow and unarmed. Their primary purpose is to transport soldiers to a combat theater. They can also be found transporting supplies from one Antarean base to another.
[armament]
None.
[personnel]
(typically) Two Worker-class Antareans, four Soldier-class Antareans, four Ortnoks, two Shevaars.
[notes]
Transports are commonly escorted by a small number of Fighters or Cruisers.

5. "Warship"
[description]
Warships are larger vessels that boast more firepower than Cruisers, and carry about as many soldiers as Transports. These craft are a dangerous force even on their own and should be engaged with caution.
[armament]
Two heavy fusion cannons, one concussion missile launcher (equivalent).
[personnel]
Four Worker-class Antareans, four Soldier-class Antareans, four Ortnoks, two Shevaars, three Hovernets.
[notes]
Warships are slower than Fighters, but faster than Scouts.

6. "Juggernaut"
[description]
Juggernauts are large vessels that form the backbone of the Antarean navy. They are deployed in ship-to-ship combat situations, but can also be used as an armored troop carrier. These vessels usually show up on the front line of a war once the Antareans have decided on a strategy.
[armament]
Two heavy fusion cannons, two concussion missile launchers (equivalent), one point-defense fusion needle.
[personnel]
Four Worker-class Antareans, one Antarean Commander, six Soldier-class Antareans, four Ortnoks, three Shevaars, four Hovernets.
[notes]

7. "Bulwark"
[description]
These massive ships are a rare sight - and a good thing too. They are armed with a powerful nova-class fusion driver, which is capable of obliterating most smaller enemy craft in a few shots. Fortunately, it has a low rate of fire. It is staffed by an elite squadron of Antarean soldiers, and is a force to be reckoned with.
[armament]
One nova fusion driver, two point-defense fusion needles.
[personnel]
Five Worker-class Antareans, one Antarean Commander, six Soldier-class Antareans, four Cyborg Otnoks, three Shevaars, five Hovernets.
[notes]
Bulwarks are slower even than scouts. They usually have some Fighter escorts to prevent hit-and-run attacks from enemy vessels, but any enemy determined enough to take on the nove fusion driver will usually not have too much trouble with those.
