Advanced Plasma Control

researchtime 90 days
required_item something that uses plasma- or related technology

[plasma_txt]
The Antareans have refined the technology to use the basic concept behind plasma (ionized gas) and perfected its use for military reasons. Not only do they use it for weapons, but they even managed to produce more powerful ion drives than mankind ever imagined possible.Your scientists could reproduce the basic concepts behind these improvements and we might even be able to produce similar equipment anytime soon.

#####################################################################
Tachyon Control

researchtime 120 days
required_item something that uses tachyon technology

[tachyon_txt]
The research on tachyons (or tardyons, the kind that moves slower than lightspeed) have long been a big white space in human science. The antarean species has not only found out how tachyons really do fit in with the rest of all matter, but also found a way to create, manipulate and annihilate them at will. The projectiles itself do not move with near-lightspeed, but on impact the energy is emitted to the target at a speed that exceeds most physical boundaries known by mankind. This knowledge has been used to create devastating weapons that they now use to terrorize humanity. Our scientists believe that we may be able to reproduce these weapons once we get more details lined up.

[alternate]
Although our engineers not fully understand the principles of altering the tachyons on a\n
subatomic level, they were able to reproduce the tachyon accelerator technology. Apparently the\n
tachyons are given a defined spin inside the accelerator so they are able to interact with any\n
material. They still tend to infiltrate easily through any known armor and lose their particle\n
energy not before a penetrating distance of about 10 cm. Therefore a soldier hit by a tachyon\n
charge suffers only minor superficial injury but is heavily wounded in his viscera.

Advanced Laser Technology

researchtime 60 days
initial technology

[laser_txt]
Laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) technology is long known by mankind, but so-called \"Tactical High-Energy Laser\" or THEL have only been around for a short period of time. Though there already exist a mobile variation of this called \"Mobile Tactical High-Energy Laser\" or MTHEL these wepaon systems are too big and inefficient to have any real advantages to conventional weapons.The basic design of these weapons normaly uses a chemical laser (deuterium fluoride laser), which our scientists recently found out how to make about 5-times more efficient and compact.This may lead to new lightweight MTHEL weapons in the near future.

#####################################################################
Nano Technology

researchtime 80 days
initial technology

[nano_txt]
Nanotechnolgoy opens up a wide field of new production methods especially in the design and production of armor and fabric.By using nanotechnology it will be possible to create materials nearly completely made of fullerenes (geodesic domes at an atomic level) and use them fabricate armor that is more robust and has higher heat resistance than any known material before. Not also that, but these materials would also be lighter than comperable conventional ones.

Anti-gravity

Until a few days ago no particles known to mankind had negative mass, although physicists have been able to describe some of the anticipated properties such particles may have. Assuming that particles with negative mass exit, this would produce a system where negative masses are attracted to positive masses, yet positive masses are repelled away from negative masses. As well, negative masses would produce an attractive force on one another, but would be repelled because of their negative inertial masses. Many controversial research project and theoretical discussions tried to proof and disproof the existance of negative mass, but neither side was 100% successful.

This mostly theoretical assumptions (since the partical part never provided any proof) have recently been confirmed by findings in alien artefacts. Antareans seem to have found a source of these particles and not only use them in small 'flying' crafts like the hovernet, but also in most of their (bigger) spacecrafts. Since no one ever though of a good name for these particles (exept some SciFi writers) the scientists who researched these particles named them NMP (Negative Mass Particle). We currently do not know where the Antareans got these NMPs from or how they may have produced them if that's possible. So right now we depend on looted NMPs from alien AntiGrav equipment. Maybe further research will reveal more on the origins of these particles.

Triax

Using robotics and artificial intelligence, Phalanx has developed an all-purpose all-terrain assault vehicle for use in ground combat without the need for human intervention. The autonomous Triax UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) has three axles and six-wheel suspension for manueverability on all terrains. It comes complete with heavy armor, AI-controlled (arificial intelligence) enemy recognition and machine gun turret.
For tactical reasons the control is a hybrid of autonomous and remote control, which provides greater flexibility in situations the artificial intelligence may not recognize/act correctly. The AI is mostly used for quick enemy recognition and precise attacks.
The only downside when using this rolling fortress of doom is the fact that it takes up alot of space in the dropship and can't reach every destination that provides enough room for it or is otherwise unreachable for ground-based units.

#####################################################################
Phoenix

Using the knowledge of the recently reverse-engineered antarean ion thruster technology, Phalanx has advanced UGV-technology (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) to create this mobile, hovering, autonomous weapon. The Phoenix can achieve strategic manuevers such as floating at any point in mid-air, scouting/attacking through second-story windows, and landing on rooftops. Though one disadvantage it shares with the Triax - its size - remains.

Multiwave Stealth Generator

An alien ship appeared at a terror site without warning or detection. Observers say that it seemed to appear out of thin air, hovering a few meters above the ground and then landing. Upon researching this ship-component found at the landing site, we can tell that the aliens have achieved stealth technology which is able to redirect not only light, but other types of waves employed in conventional radar technologies. Upon researching other alien hardware, we may be able to recreate the components needed for a working stealth system.

researchtime 200 days
requires "Alien Palm Computer"
requires_item "Multiwave Stealth Generator" (from large alien ship)

#####################################################################
MW Stealth Detection

It appears that with current human technology, detecting ships equipped with multiwave stealth equipment is impossible. We can only hope to obtain research data on Alien Radar Technology in the future.

researchtime 120 days
requires "Multiwave Stealth Generator"

#####################################################################
### TODO: sync this with the current crafts if needed
MW Stealth Carrier

Carrying up to twenty soldiers, the MW Stealth Carrier is a heavy transport vessel employing an enhanced version of the alien Multiwave Stealth Generator. Using our knowledge of alien radar, we can now evade it's detection. Completely invisible to alien radar, this ship could be the key to ultimate victory.

#####################################################################
Ion Condensor

This device, discovered in the engine room of an alien vessel, is the key to UFO propulsion technology based on highly efficient ion thrusters. Unlike previous human experimentation with Ion propulsion, the ion condensor accelerates the ion buildup using previously unknown particle technologies, making it possible to achieve incredible amounts of thrust in an instant. Research into ion thruster technology could allow us to create usable devices employing Ion propulsion.

researchtime 240 days
requires _item "Ion Condensor" (requires that an Ion Condensor was obtained from a large alien ship)

#####################################################################
Ion Thruster Technology
Phalanx is now able to recreate the advanced ion thruster technology found in alien propulsion units. We have recently produced a complete working prototype of an ion propulsion system. This prototype provides instantaneous and controllable thrust, using advanced particle technologies to reduce power requirements. We can now start designing working vehicles that implement this technology.

#####################################################################
Alien Translation Device

This device, discovered on an alien general, is the key to alien interspecies communication. This will enable us to research the languege used by the aliens and eventually translate it to human language.

researchtime 120 days
requires_item "Alien Translation Device" (obtained from the unconscious body or corpse of one of the rarely encountered Alien Generals)

#####################################################################
Alien Language

Though each alien race seems to have a native tongue that matches its physical communication abilities, the group of alien races invading earth have developed a common lanuage of communication used in all text communications and computer hardware, enabling interspecies communications.

Alien langage will help us unlock alien devices and possibly uncover information critical to the invasion.

researchtime 160 days
requires "Alien Translation Device"

#####################################################################
Alien Palm Computer

This small mobile device is an amazing combination of nanotechnology and optical circuits. The data on this device would be impossible to decode without researching the language used by the aliens.

researchtime 240 days
requires "Nanotechnology"
requires "Multiwave Stealth Generator"
requires_item "Alien Palm Computer" (obtained from an alien commander)

#####################################################################
Alien Mothership

According to data translated from an alien palm computer, the Alien Mothership is the command center of the alien invasion. It's armaments are such that it could destroy a whole fleet of human vessels in a short time, making a direct attack impossible. We can only hope to find a safe way to board this ship and destroy it from the inside.

TODO: location of the ship.
TODO: Explaination of why it isn't attacking directly.

#####################################################################
Alien Radar Technology

Alien Radar gives us an brief insight into subatomic-particle radar systems. This data from an alien palm computer, combined with research of alien stealth hardware, could lead to production of a device that could detect alien stealth ships, or a stealth drive that prevents detection by Alien Radar.

requires "Alien Palm Computer"
requires "MW Stealth Detection"

#####################################################################
Dark Radar

Using data obtained from alien computers and hardware, Phalanx has created a design plan for a radar system that employs subatomic-particles much like alien radar does. Once built, this new device could be the key to locating the alien mothership. Using a MW Stealth Carrier, Phalanx could board the ship and hope to destroy it from the inside, which seems to be the only possible way to defeat it.
