==Windows Notes==
On Windows generating a repository is not supported. All parameters are ignored and an upgrade is allways performed. This helps windows users as they just need to double click the map-get file.

return codes
1 - programming error or unexpected abort (ctrl + c for example)
    if there was no user interaction you migh want to report this as a bug
2 - usage error
3 - user abort (probably after a warning)
5 - path error
6 - download error
